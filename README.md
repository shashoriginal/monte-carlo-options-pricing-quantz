# Monte Carlo Options Pricing - QuantZ

This repository contains the Monte Carlo Options Pricing module for the QuantZ education platform. It provides interactive tools and visualizations to understand and implement Monte Carlo simulations for pricing various types of options.

## Features

- **Interactive Simulations**: Visualize stock price paths and option price convergence
- **Multiple Option Types**: Price European, Asian, Lookback, Barrier, and Binary options
- **Greeks Calculation**: Calculate and visualize option Greeks using finite difference methods
- **Variance Reduction Techniques**: Explore methods to improve simulation efficiency
- **Practice Problems**: Test your understanding with randomized practice problems

## Implementation

The implementation uses modern web technologies:
- **HTML/CSS**: For structure and styling
- **JavaScript**: For calculations and interactivity
- **Chart.js/Plotly.js**: For data visualization
- **KaTeX**: For mathematical formula rendering

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start exploring Monte Carlo options pricing techniques.
